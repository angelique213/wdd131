    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <h3>Site Name</h3>
      <p><strong>Souls</strong></p>
      <p>A simple, peaceful scripture generator that helps users find uplifting verses or chapters for their soul.</p>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of <strong>Souls</strong> is to provide uplifting scripture passages that offer peace, guidance,
        and spiritual strength. The site will let users generate random verses or chapters and select a book to quickly
        find meaningful scripture to study or share.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The intended audience includes individuals seeking daily spiritual inspiration, students who want a simple
        scripture reference tool, and anyone looking for peace and light in God’s word. The design will be calm,
        minimal, and easy to use on both mobile and desktop devices.

    <!-- DYNAMIC ELEMENTS -->
    <section>
      <h2>Dynamic Elements (JavaScript)</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript will power the scripture generator by handling user actions and updating the page dynamically.
        Users will be able to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click a button to receive a random scripture verse or chapter.</li>
        <li>Select whether to generate a chapter or a verse.</li>
        <li>Select a book to generate a verse or chapter.</li>
        <li>Save verses to a personal journal and write notes about them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The project will use <strong>objects</strong> to represent verses and scripture data, <strong>arrays</strong> to store
        collections of verses, and <strong>array methods</strong> like <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, and <code>forEach</code> to process and
        display that data. ES <strong>modules</strong> will be used to organize the JavaScript into separate files
        (for example, one module for data and another for UI logic). Conditional statements will be used to control
        random selection, handle missing data, validate user choices, and show different messages depending on what
        the user does.

    <section>
      <h2>Content</h2>

      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will introduce the Souls scripture generator in a simple and calming layout. A hero section will
        display the logo, the title “Souls,” and a short tagline such as “Words that lift the soul.” Below the hero
        section, a main card will invite the user to generate a scripture. When the user clicks the button, a random
        scripture verse and its reference will appear in the card.
      </p>
      <p>
        The home page will also include simple controls that allow users to select a book and choose whether they want
        a verse or a chapter. After they click the button, the result card will display the scripture, the reference,
        and optional actions such as copy and “Add to favorites.” The focus of the home page is to give users immediate
        access to inspiration with minimal distractions.
      </p>

      <h3>Journal Page</h3>
      <p>
        The Journal page will allow users to view the scripture verses or chapters they have saved and write personal
        notes or reflections about each one. Each saved scripture will appear in a card with the verse text, reference,
        and a text area or input for journaling. Users will be able to edit or update their notes so they can record
        impressions from their scripture study over time.
      </p>
