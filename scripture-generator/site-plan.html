    <h1>Souls – Scripture Generator</h1>
    <h2>Site Plan</h2>
    <p>WDD 131 | Angelique Legaspi</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Site Name</h2>
      <p><strong>Souls</strong></p>
      <p>A simple, peaceful scripture generator that helps users find uplifting verses for their soul.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of <strong>Souls</strong> is to provide uplifting scripture passages that offer peace, guidance,
        and spiritual strength. The site will let users generate random verses or select a book and chapter to quickly
        find meaningful scripture to study or share.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>
        The intended audience includes individuals seeking daily spiritual inspiration, students who want a simple
        scripture reference tool, and anyone looking for peace and light in God’s word. The design will be calm,
        minimal, and easy to use on both mobile and desktop devices.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dynamic Elements (JavaScript)</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript will power the scripture generator by handling user actions and updating the page dynamically.
        Users will be able to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click a button to receive a random scripture verse.</li>
        <li>Select a book and chapter to generate a verse from that location.</li>
        <li>See the DOM update as verses, references, and messages change based on their choices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The project will use <strong>objects</strong> to represent verses and scripture data, <strong>arrays</strong> to store
        collections of verses, and <strong>array methods</strong> like <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, and <code>forEach</code> to process and
        display that data. ES <strong>modules</strong> will be used to organize the JavaScript into separate files
        (for example, one module for data and another for UI logic). Conditional statements will be used to control
        random selection, handle missing data, validate user choices, and show different messages depending on what
        the user does.
      </p>

      <h2>Logo</h2>
      <p>
        The logo represents a figure walking toward light and mountains, symbolizing the journey of the soul toward
        truth and peace.

        <h3>Body Text Example</h3>

          This site helps users find uplifting scriptures through a simple verse generator and a chapter-based scripture finder.

      <h2>Content</h2>

      <h3>Home Page – Souls</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will introduce the Souls scripture generator in a simple and calming layout. A hero section will
        display the logo, the title “Souls,” and a short tagline such as “Words that lift the soul.” Below the hero
        section, a main card will invite the user to generate a scripture. When the user clicks the button, a random
        verse and its reference will appear in the card. The focus of the home page is to give users immediate access
        to inspiration with minimal distractions.
      </p>

      <h3>Generator Page – Scripture Finder</h3>
      <p>
        The generator page will function more like a tool. It will allow users to select a book and chapter from
        dropdown menus and then click a button to receive a verse from that chapter. A result card will display the
        verse, the reference, and optional actions such as copying the verse. This page will help users who want
        scripture from a specific part of the Bible or another selected volume of scripture.
      </p>

      <h3>Additional Text / Labels</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>“Generate Scripture” – main button on the home page.</li>
        <li>“Click the button to receive a scripture.” – default message in the verse card.</li>
        <li>“Choose a book and chapter to receive a verse.” – instructions on the generator page.</li>
        <li>“For God so loved the world…” – example verse for layout and testing.</li>
        <li>Footer text: “© 2025 Souls — Guided by Scripture”</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>

      <h3>Home Page Wireframe</h3>
      <p>
        The home page wireframe features a header with the logo and navigation, a large hero section with the Souls
        title and a “Generate Scripture” button, and a centered card below where the verse appears. The footer runs
        across the bottom with a simple copyright line.
      </p>
      <div class="wireframe-wrapper">
        <img src="images/wireframe-home-souls.jpg" alt="Home page wireframe for Souls scripture generator">
      </div>

      <h3>Generator Page Wireframe</h3>
      <p>
        The generator page wireframe shows the same header and footer for consistency. The main content includes a
        short description, two dropdowns (book and chapter), a “Get Verse” button, and a result card that displays the
        verse text and reference. The layout is focused on clarity and ease of use.
